	In Greek mythology, the Muses, the goddesses of inspiration...

<words x=10 y=450 w=350 h=60>
	...were the daughters of Mnemosyne: the goddess of Memory.

	But, there's another way to learn

	It's a memory card game you can play, for ~20 minutes a day,

	I first started using Spaced Repetition earlier this year, to learn French.
</words>
<words x=30 y=350 w=430 h=60>
	In two <i>months</i>, I learnt more words than I did in two <i>years</i>
	of high school French class.

<panel w=500 h=450>
<pic src="pics/intro0.png" sx=950 sy=450></pic>
<words x=10 y=10 w=400 h=60>
	Since then, I've used Spaced Repetition to learn all sorts of things...
</words>
<words x=60 y=350 w=400 h=60>
	...and this lil' card game became a core part of my <i>life</i>.
</words>

<words x=10 y=10 w=500 h=30>
	In short, Spaced Repetition is “flashcards on steroids”.
</words>
<words x=10 y=220 w=500 h=90>
	You test yourself on a fact a few times, spacing out your repetitions over time.
	(<i>How</i> it's spaced is crucial, and clever. More on that later.)
</words>
</panel>

<panel w=400 h=400>
<pic src="pics/intro0.png" sx=0 sy=1200></pic>
<words x=10 y=20 w=290 no-bg>
	Spaced Repetition is free, evidence-based, and so simple you can do it with a <i>shoebox</i>.
</words>
<words x=90 y=130 w=270 no-bg>
	So, what's the catch? Why isn't <i>everyone</i> already doing Spaced Repetition?
</words>
</panel>

<panel w=400 h=400>
<pic src="pics/intro0.png" sx=400 sy=1200></pic>
<words x=10 y=20 w=330 no-bg>
	Well, the catch is that making <i>any</i> new habit is hard
	– especially a weird one like Spaced Repetition.
</words>
<words x=110 y=130 w=260 no-bg>
	That's why I made this interactive comic: to help.
</words>

<words x=10 y=20 w=300 no-bg>
	In this comic on Spaced Repetition,
	I'll show you WHY it works, HOW it works...
</words>
<words x=110 y=130 w=250 no-bg>
	...and help you get started with it <i>TODAY.</i>

Also, throughout this comic,
you can test yourself on what you've learnt,
at spaced-out intervals.
<b>That is: you'll use Spaced Repetition to learn about Spaced Repetition.</b>

Like so:

	Spaced Repetition isn't a "study trick".
	It isn't a "life hack".
</words>
<words x=30 y=110 w=320 no-bg>
	It's a way to take back control of your <i>mind.</i>
	To make long-term memory a <i>choice</i>.
	To develop a lifelong love for learning...
