<!-- Part 1.1: Leitner Calendar -->

<pic></pic> <!-- hey susan, TRAINERS -->
<words x=10 y=10 w=430 h=60>
	You don't <i>have</i> to use a shoebox for Spaced Repetition,
	but it's funnier if you do.
</words>
<words x=30 y=350 w=430 h=60>
	(Later, we'll look at some Spaced Repetition <i>apps</i>,
	like Anki &amp; Tinycards)
</words>
</panel>

<panel w=500 h=400>

<words x=10 y=10 w=430 h=60>
	This method is called The Leitner System.
	It's like a card game you play against yourself!
</words>
<words x=30 y=300 w=430 h=60>
	First, divide your box up into seven "Levels".
	Each Level will store some flashcards.
</words>
</panel>

<panel w=400 h=200 bg="#bada55">
"wait, what's a flashcard?"
<!-- This is, ya goof -->

</panel>

<panel w=600 h=80>
<words w=600 x=-15 no-bg>
	We need to space out our recalls with <i>increasing gaps of time</i>.
	So, here's a calendar of when to review which Level's cards:
</words>

</panel>


<!-- Part 1.2: Leitner Rules -->

<panel w=600 h=80>
<words w=600 x=-15 no-bg>
	But how do cards move <i>between</i> Levels?
	How do you play this game of Spaced Repetition Solitaire?
</words>
</panel>

<panel w=500 h=400>
<pic></pic> <!-- joyful baby card... and grisly card -->
<words x=10 y=10 w=430 h=60>
	The rules are simple.
	First, all new cards start at Level 1.
</words>
<words x=30 y=300 w=430 h=60>
	(If you're new to Spaced Repetition, I recommend starting with 5 new cards a day.)
</words>
</panel>

<panel w=500 h=430>
<pic></pic> <!-- valhalla -->
<words x=10 y=10 w=430 h=90>
	When you review the cards in a Level, first, shuffle them.
	Then, try to recall them.
	Each card you get right goes up one Level.
</words>
<words x=30 y=330 w=430 h=60>
	(If you're already at the final Level, congrats!
	Your card gets to retire in Valhalla)
</words>
</panel>

<panel w=500 h=400>
<pic></pic> <!-- HIGH STAKES -->
<words x=10 y=10 w=430 h=60>
	But each card you get wrong... goes
	<i>all the way back down to Level 1.</i>
</words>
<words x=30 y=300 w=430 h=60>
	(You can change the rules – it's <i>your</i> shoebox –
	but I recommend playing it this way)
</words>
</panel>

<panel w=500 h=400>
<pic></pic> <!-- baby + REMEMBER ME?! -->
<words x=10 y=10 w=430 h=60>
	Each day, you review Level 1 at the end.
	You'll see your new cards + the cards you forgot.
</words>
<words x=30 y=300 w=430 h=60>
	Keep trying to recall them, until you can get <i>every one</i> right!
	Move them all to Level 2.
</words>
</panel>

<panel w=600 h=80>
<words w=600 x=-15 no-bg>
	And that's it! 
	Here's how the game plays out over several days:
	(Later, we'll see a sim for several <i>months</i>)

<!-- Part 1.3: Leitner Full Sim -->

<panel w=600 h=110>
<words w=600 x=-15 no-bg>
	Each daily session takes 20-30 minutes.
	Instead of watching a TV episode, you could play a card game –
	and remember anything you want <i>for life</i>.
</words>
</panel>

<panel w=500 h=400>
<pic></pic> <!-- snowball -->
<words x=10 y=10 w=430 h=60>
	However, habits are hard. If you start big, you won't get the ball rolling...
</words>
<words x=30 y=300 w=430 h=60>
	But if you start <i>small</i>, you can gain momentum,
	and roll your snowball bigger and bigger.
</words>
</panel>

<panel w=500 h=690>
<pic></pic> <!-- katamari damacy -->
<words x=10 y=10 w=430 h=60>
	That's why I recommend <i>starting</i> with 5 new cards a day.
</words>
<words x=30 y=300 w=430 h=60>
	Once you're comfortable with that, you can do 10 new cards/day.
	Then 15. Then 20, 25, 30.
</words>
<words x=10 y=590 w=430 h=60>
	And at 30 new cards a day, you can learn <i>10,000+</i> new facts/words/etc a <i>year.</i>
</words>
</panel>

<panel w=600 h=50>
<words w=600 x=-15 no-bg>
	Here's what that looks like, over several months:

</panel>



<!-- Part 1.3: Leitner Outro -->

<panel w=600 h=110>
<words w=600 x=-15 no-bg>
	That's it. That's how you can make long-term memory a <i>choice</i>.
</words>	
<words w=600 x=-15 y=50 no-bg>
	Let's let that sink in. Take a break, and recall what we just learnt:

<!-- Part 2.1: Pitfalls -->

<panel w=600 h=80>
<words w=600 x=-15 no-bg>
	Spaced Repetition almost seems too good to be true.
	<br>
	And it is... <i>IF</i> you fall for 3 very common pitfalls.
</words>	
</panel>

<panel w=500 h=450>
<pic></pic> <!-- Library, humor -->
<words x=10 y=10 w=430 h=60>
	Spaced Repetition will fail if your cards feel
	bloated, disconnected, or meaningless.
</words>
<words x=30 y=350 w=430 h=60>
	Memory isn't a private library,
	where you hoard a bunch of random books to impress others.
</words>
</panel>

<panel w=500 h=450>
<pic></pic> <!-- ANGRY FACE -->
<words x=10 y=10 w=430 h=90>
	Memory is more like a jigsaw puzzle, full of tiny pieces joined together.
	(This is also how neurons work: lots of tiny, connected things)
</words>
<words x=30 y=380 w=430 h=30>
	It's not about <i>collection</i>, it's about <i>connection</i>.
</words>
</panel>
<panel w=500 h=400>
<pic></pic>
<words x=10 y=10 w=410 h=60>
	So, to get the most out of Spaced Repetition,
	you must make your cards...
</words>
<!--SMALL, CONNECTED, and MEANINGFUL.-->
</panel>

<!-- Part 2.2: Small -->

<panel w=600 h=100 bg="#000">
<words x=10 y=10 w=400>
	<b>SMALL</b>

</panel>

<panel w=450 h=350>
<pic></pic>
<words x=10 y=10 w=400 h=30>
	It's too big. Too much information.
</words>
<words x=10 y=250 w=400 h=60>
	Instead, let's cut in up into a bunch of smaller, connected pieces,
	like so:

</panel>

<panel w=450 h=90>
<words w=450 x=-15 no-bg>
	Facts connect to facts.
	But there's other, more playful ways for cards to be...

</panel>


<!-- Part 2.3: Connected -->

<panel w=600 h=100 bg="#000">
<words x=10 y=10 w=400>
	<b>CONNECTED</b>
</words>
</panel>

<panel w=450 h=110>
<words w=450 x=-15 no-bg>
	This card is... alright.
	It's an English word on the front, French word on the back.
	It's the standard for most flashcards:

<panel w=400 h=200 bg="#bada55">

<panel w=450 h=400>
<pic></pic>
<words x=10 y=10 w=400 h=60>
	But you know what would make it stick in memory better?
</words>
<words x=10 y=300 w=400 h=60>
	If you connected it to
	<i>images, sounds, context, and/or personal details!</i>
	Like so:

<panel w=600 h=300>
<pic></pic>
<words x=10 y=10 w=200>
	The front now has a drawing of a cat (image)
	with a fill-in-the-blank French sentence (context: grammar)
	about my childhood cat, Stripes. (personal)
</words>
</panel>

<panel w=600 h=300>

<words x=10 y=10 w=200>
	The back now has a symbol of the noun's gender (image),
	its pronunciation (sound*),
	and a warning not to use the female version. (context: slang)
</words>
<words w=330 x=240 y=230 no-bg fontsize=20>
	* Obviously, paper cards can't play sounds.
	But apps like Anki/Tinycards can!
</words>
</panel>

<panel w=450 h=90>
<words w=450 x=-15 no-bg>
	But the <i>most</i> important connection of all,
	is to connect your learning to something that is...

	By making sure your learning is in service of <i>something you actually care about.</i>
