	Seriously, why memorize anything when we can just look it up?
</words>
<words x=30 y=350 w=430 h=60>
	And besides, isn't rote memorization bad?
	Shouldn't we focus instead on teaching creativity and critical thinking?

	In 2013, a meta-study of 100+ other studies ranked how effective (or not)

Hey, why don't you take a guess at what works &amp; what doesn't?

<!-- Re-reading -->

<!--
What?! Aren't you supposed to get better the more you practice something?
Scroll down, and let's find out what's up...
-->
</panel>

<!-- Testing Yourself -->
<panel w=600 h=300 bg="#ff4040">
<!-- Ah... that's why re-reading doesn't work.
	When you re-read, you're only practicing "feeling familiar".
    When you test yourself, you're practicing ACTUAL RECALL. -->
</panel>

<!-- Highlighting/underlining -->
<panel w=600 h=300 bg="#ff4040">
<!-- Same problem as re-reading. You're not actually practicing RECALL. -->
</panel>

<!-- Spacing -->
<panel w=600 h=300 bg="#ff4040">
<!-- You know how you cram for an exam, then one month later you remember nothing?
	Cramming only works short-term. If you want long-term, space it out.

<words x=30 y=350 w=430 h=60>
	...which can be combined into a simple but powerful method called “Spaced Repetition”.

</panel>

<!-- What is Spaced Repetition? -->

<!-- FREAKING AWESOME, THAT'S WHAT -->

	Spaced Repetition has <i>changed my life.</i>
</words>
</panel>

<panel w=500 h=450>
<pic style="background:#bada55"></pic> <!-- examples -->
<words x=10 y=10 w=430 h=60>
	Spaced Repetition is most popular for language-learning,
</words>
<words x=30 y=350 w=430 h=60>
	but I, and friends I know, are using it to learn so much more!
</words>
</panel>

<panel w=500 h=450>
<pic style="background:#bada55"></pic> <!-- Teacher standing behind Nicky with ruler -->
<words x=10 y=10 w=430 h=60>
	In this interactive comic, I want to share with you the science &amp; art of Spaced Repetition...
</words>
<words x=30 y=350 w=430 h=60>
	...and help you get started using it <i>today.</i>
</words>
</panel>

And throughout this comic,
you can test yourself on what you've learnt,
in spaced-out intervals.

<b>That is, you'll use Spaced Repetition to learn about Spaced Repetition.</b>

Like so:

<!-- Review -->
<panel w=600 h=400 bg="#ff4040">
<!--
Three popular but ineffective learning techniques are: (re-reading), (highlighting), (cramming)
The two most science-backed ways to learn are: (testing yourself) and (
The Goddess of (Memory) is the mother of the goddesses of (Inspiration)

</panel>

<!-- Not study hacks -->
<panel w=500 h=450>
<pic style="background:#bada55"></pic>  <!-- A spanked Nicky -->
<words x=10 y=10 w=430 h=60>
	I want to clarify something.
	This isn't just a "study trick" or a "life hack".
</words>
<words x=30 y=350 w=430 h=60>
	This is a way to take control of your <i>mind.</i>
	To make long-term memory a <i>choice</i>.
	To develop a lifelong love for learning...
