	In Greek mythology, the Muses, the goddesses of inspiration...

	Memorization gets a bad rap.
</words>
<words x=30 y=150 w=430 h=60>
	We all know too well school's "drill and kill" rote memorization.

<panel w=500 h=250>
<pic style="background:#bada55"></pic> <!-- talking in class -->

	But not only are traditional lectures &amp; study techniques boring,

	What if there was a better way?

	What if you could play a memory card game with yourself,
	every day for ~20 minutes,

	I first started using Spaced Repetition earlier this year,
	when I begun learning French on my own.
</words>
<words x=30 y=350 w=430 h=60>
	Within two months of using Spaced Repetition,
	I'd learnt more words than I did in two <i>years</i>
	of high school French.
</words>
</panel>

<panel w=500 h=450>
<pic style="background:#bada55"></pic>
<words x=10 y=10 w=430 h=60>
	But wait, there's more!
	A friend then showed me how to use Spaced Repetition to learn <i>anything</i>,
	not just new languages.
</words>
<words x=30 y=350 w=430 h=60>
	Since then, I've also been using it to learn programming,
	ukulele chords, poems, and interesting tidbits from articles &amp; talks
	I come across.
</words>
</panel>

<panel w=500 h=450>
<pic style="background:#bada55"></pic>
<words x=10 y=10 w=430 h=60>
	I've even seen people use Spaced Repetition to 
	improve their <i>personal lives</i>...
</words>
<words x=30 y=150 w=430 h=60>
	by using it to remember details about friends
	(birthdays, pets' names, dietary restrictions)
	and acquaintances (names, faces, occupations)...
</words>
<words x=30 y=350 w=430 h=60>
	or using it to remember what to do/not do,
	to make new habits or break bad habits!

<!-- This Comic: YOU. (efficacy) -->
<panel w=500 h=250>
<pic style="background:#bada55"></pic>
<words x=10 y=10 w=430 h=60>
	so what's the catch
</words>
</panel>

<panel w=500 h=250>
<pic style="background:#bada55"></pic> <!-- are you a cult -->
<words x=10 y=10 w=430 h=60>
	None! It's free, it's evidence-based,
	and it's so simple,
	you can do Spaced Repetition with a <i>shoebox.</i>
</words>
<words x=30 y=150 w=430 h=60>
	In this interactive comic, I'll show you 
	WHY it works, HOW it works, and help you get started using Spaced Repetition <i>today.</i>
</words>
</panel>

<panel w=500 h=250>
<pic style="background:#bada55"></pic> <!-- is this the initiation ritual -->
<words x=10 y=10 w=430 h=60>
	Okay, the catch is this:
	it's hard to create <i>any</i> new habit,
	even a simple habit like Spaced Repetition.
</words>
<words x=30 y=150 w=430 h=60>
	But, I hope this interactive comic will help you take the first few steps.
	How?

<panel w=500 h=250>
<pic style="background:#bada55"></pic> <!-- do i need to sacrifice a goat -->
<words x=10 y=10 w=430 h=60>
	By having you learn about Spaced Repetition
</words>
<words x=30 y=150 w=430 h=60>
	<i>USING</i> Spaced Repetition!

<!-- Ergo: SR WITH SR -->

<panel w=600 h=100>
Heck, let's practice it right now!
Spaced Repetition is like flashcards, but with a twist.
Go through these cards, and see how well you remember them:
</panel>

<panel w=600 h=400 bg="#e0e0e0">
<!--
<sim x=0 y=0 w=600 h=400 src="sims/multicard/?cards=sci_a,sci_b,sci_c"></sim>
-->
</panel>

<panel w=500 h=400>
<pic style="background:#bada55"></pic> <!-- clever clock -->
<words x=10 y=10 w=430 h=60>
	The twist is in the <i>timing</i>.
	Spaced Repetition spaces out when you repeat a card,
	in a clever, scientifically-backed way.
</words>
<words x=10 y=150 w=430 h=60>
	(we'll practice Spaced Repetition a few more times in this interactive comic)
</words>
<words x=30 y=250 w=430 h=60>
	I'll explain more later,
	but for now, I want to say what Spaced Repetition is <i>not:</i>

<!-- Muse: not lifehack, but control over your memory -->
<panel w=500 h=250>
<pic style="background:#bada55"></pic> <!-- back in class, sitting in corner -->
<words x=10 y=10 w=430 h=60>
	It's <i>not</i> a "study trick".
	It's <i>not</i> a "life hack".
</words>
<words x=30 y=150 w=430 h=60>
	It's a way to take back control of your <i>mind.</i>
	To make long-term memory a <i>choice</i>.
	To develop a lifelong love for learning...
